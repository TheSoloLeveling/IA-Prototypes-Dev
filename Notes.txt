1. Convert Image to grayscale

2. Reduce Noise ==> Image noise create falses edges and affect edge detection
                ==> Using Gaussian filter : 
                    In a grayscale image, Modify the value of a pixel with the average value of the 
                    pixel intensities using a kernel of normally distributed numbers which is run across
                    the entire image and sets each pixel to the weighted average of its neighboring pixels
                    thus smoothing our image

3. Edge detection   ==> edge is a sharp change in intensity or sharp change in color between adjacent
                    pixels in the image
                    ==> Strong gradient = steep change / Small gradient = shallow change
                    ==> we consider the image a continuous function f(x,y)
                    ==> To determine a rapid changes in brightness of the image, we perform a derivative
                    in both x and y directions, thereby measuring the change in intensity with respect
                    to adjacent pixels
                    ==> Using Canny function

4. Hough Line Transform  ==> To detect straight lines in the image
                    Hough Space
